# weather-forecast
this is a web-application which i have built to check the weather of the different locations.here , the user enters the location as a input such as city,
state orcountry name then the aplication fetches the weather details from the weather api. the weather details contains tempearture,humidity, and windspeed. 
If the location name is invlaid then it displays the  message saying location is invalid.This was built using javascript,html and css.
